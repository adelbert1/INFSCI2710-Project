# Database Management Systems: Final Project

## Purpose of the project
Within this project, we have analyzed the requirements, designed, implemented, documented and demonstrated a database system that can be used by a help desk staff to ensure customer issues are resolved.

To accomplish this, we have created a catalog of products provided by the company. Accordingly, we have designed the system so that it can maintain a record of customers 
and the products that each customer owns. As each product is purchased by a customer, the database is able to be updated to reflect what each customer owns. 
The database is able to keep track of customers including their personal information and purchase history. 

Additionally, the database is able to keep track of employees that work at the company. These employees are the primary users of the database software. Employees can open cases to
support the products and see the cases through to associated resolutions which are also tracked within the database.

For an extensive overview and detailed descriptions of each aspect of this database project, please refer to the the "Database Management Systems Final Report" document. This document includes a table of contents which will enable you to quickly navigate to any areas of interest.
